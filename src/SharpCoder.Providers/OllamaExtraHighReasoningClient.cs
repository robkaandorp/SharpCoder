/// <b>Investigation method:</b> (1) decompiled <c>OllamaSharp.dll</c> 5.4.30 with <c>ilspycmd</c>
/// and read <c>OllamaSharp.MicrosoftAi.AbstractionMapper.ToOllamaSharpChatRequest</c>; (2) confirmed
/// the finding with a request-capture test — an <see cref="OllamaSharp.OllamaApiClient"/> built over an
/// <see cref="HttpClient"/> whose terminal handler recorded the outgoing body, driven through
/// <c>IChatClient.GetResponseAsync</c>/<c>GetStreamingResponseAsync</c> for every
/// <see cref="ReasoningEffort"/> value.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Finding:</b> the mapper contains
/// <c>request.Think = options.Reasoning.Effort switch { null =&gt; null, None =&gt; false, Low =&gt; "low",
/// Medium =&gt; "medium", _ =&gt; "high" }</c>. The <c>_</c> arm swallows both <c>High</c> and
/// <c>ExtraHigh</c>, so <b>both serialize to the identical body</b>
/// <c>{"...","think":"high"}</c>. The collapse happens <em>inside</em> OllamaSharp before any HTTP
/// body exists, so a <see cref="DelegatingHandler"/> can never distinguish the two: by the time the
/// body reaches the transport, <c>ExtraHigh</c> and <c>High</c> are byte-identical, and rewriting
/// <c>"high"</c> would silently upgrade genuine <see cref="ReasoningEffort.High"/> requests.
/// The fix therefore has to act at the <see cref="ChatOptions"/> level, before serialization.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Chosen mechanism:</b> the mapper begins with
/// <c>request = options.RawRepresentationFactory?.Invoke(chatClient) is ChatRequest raw ? raw : new ChatRequest()</c>
/// and thereafter only fills members that are still <see langword="null"/> — including
/// <c>Think</c>, which the <c>Reasoning.Effort</c> switch sets only when
/// <c>!request.Think.HasValue</c>. So supplying a <c>ChatRequest</c> whose <c>Think</c> is already
/// <c>"max"</c> makes the collapse switch a no-op and puts <c>"think":"max"</c> on the wire.
/// This wrapper therefore <em>composes</em> the caller's
/// <see cref="ChatOptions.RawRepresentationFactory"/>: the replacement invokes the original factory
/// exactly once, and fills <c>Think</c> on that very result only when the caller left it unset.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why composition rather than inspection:</b> the framework contract asks a factory to return a
/// fresh instance per invocation, and factories may be stateful or non-deterministic. Calling the
/// factory once to inspect it and letting OllamaSharp call it again to build the request would
/// evaluate caller code twice and could observe a different <c>Think</c> in each call — overwriting
/// a real explicit value or wrongly suppressing <c>max</c>. Composition evaluates the caller's
/// factory exactly once, on the same object that is actually serialized, so the decision and the
/// outcome can never disagree. The composed factory also forwards the <see cref="IChatClient"/>
/// argument it receives untouched: OllamaSharp passes the underlying <c>OllamaApiClient</c>
/// (verified), so factories that inspect the supplied client still see what they expect rather than
/// this decorator.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Alternative considered and rejected:</b> <c>ChatOptions.AdditionalProperties["think"]</c>,
/// which the mapper applies via <c>TryAddOllamaOption(OllamaOption.Think, …)</c>. That route runs
/// <em>after</em> the raw request is adopted, so it unconditionally overwrites an explicit
/// <c>ChatRequest.Think</c> supplied through <c>RawRepresentationFactory</c> (verified by request
/// capture: raw <c>Think="low"</c> plus the additional property emitted <c>"think":"max"</c>).
/// It is therefore unusable for a wrapper that must respect caller intent. An explicit
/// <c>AdditionalProperties["think"]</c> set by the caller still wins, because it is applied last —
/// this wrapper short-circuits on it so the caller's options are returned untouched.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Scope of mutation:</b> only <see cref="ReasoningEffort.ExtraHigh"/> is intercepted, and only
/// when the caller has not already expressed an explicit <c>think</c> through either mechanism —
/// an explicit caller value always wins. The caller's <see cref="ChatOptions"/> is never mutated:
/// a clone carries the composed factory, matching the contract of
/// <see cref="ReasoningEffortClampingClient"/>.
